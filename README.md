## ESTIMATION OF DETECTION PROBABILITY IN MULTITARGET FILTERS  USING OBJECT ADVANCED IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES
author: Michal Seibert

This Gitlab repository includes implementation of the GM-PHD filter the with dynamic detection probability
using object detection and segmentation image processing deep-learning algorithms.
